# Memory

(Language related short-term memory tasks)

##### Dowload the [latest version](https://github.com/hanayik/Memory/releases/latest)

### Description
These tasks assess language related short-term memory abilities in stroke patients. The app contains a few different tasks ranging from non-word rhyming judgement to real word rhyme judgement with a dual task filled interval between the spoken words. These tasks are based on the TALSA battery.  

The saved data location will depend on your computer. The program automatically detects if you have Dropbox, or Box folders on your computer and tries to save to those locations first, in that order. If you do not wish to save to the cloud folders then uncheck that option in the menu bar. If the cloud saving option is unchecked, or those folders do not exist on your computer then the app will save to it's default MacOS location which is ``` ~/Library/Application Support/Memory/data ```
